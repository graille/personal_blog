## Presentation

In 2008, David Bishop released a first version of the FPHDL library, containing the **fixed_pkg** and **float_pkg** packages. 
These packages are now part of VHDL-2008 standard, and can be used in any VHDL-2008 project with a license.

However, David Bishop provides a VHDL-93 versions of those packages which were published before the release of the VHDL LRM.
These libraries are free of copyright restrictions, and may be used "for whatever purpose is needed", including commercial usages.

Moreover, this package is fully compatible with VHDL-2008 libraries. So, a migration from a 93-project using this libraries to built-in VHDL-2008 libraries should be easy.

This page present some examples of what can be done with it.

## Examples
### Fixed-point

#### Addition

Native VHDL :

```vhdl
architecture behavioural of e is
  signal a : signed((1 + A_INT_PART + A_FRACT_PART) - 1 downto 0);
  signal b : signed((1 + B_INT_PART + B_FRACT_PART) - 1 downto 0);

  -- We want c = a + b without loss
  constant C_INT_PART = MAX(A_INT_PART, B_INT_PART) + 1;
  constant C_FRACT_PART = MAX(A_FRACT_PART, B_FRACT_PART);
  
  signal c : signed((1 + C_INT_PART + C_FRACT_PART) downto 0);
begin
  process(CLK)
    variable temp_a : signed(c'length - 1 downto 0);
    variable temp_b : signed(c'length - 1 downto 0);
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then
      -- Align a and b
      temp_a := shift_right(resize(a, c'length), A_FRACT_PART - C_FRACT_PART);
      temp_a := shift_right(resize(b, c'length), B_FRACT_PART - C_FRACT_PART);

      c <= a + b;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioural;
```

With fixed_pkg library

```vhdl
architecture behavioural of entity is
  signal a : sfixed(A_INT_PART downto -A_FRACT_PART);
  signal b : sfixed(B_INT_PART downto -B_FRACT_PART);

  -- We want c = a + b without loss
  signal c : sfixed(sfixed_high(a, '+', b) downto sfixed_low(a, '+', b));
begin
  process(CLK)
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then
      c <= a + b;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioural;
```

#### Multiplication

Native VHDL

```vhdl
architecture behavioural of entity is
  signal a : signed((1 + A_INT_PART + A_FRACT_PART) - 1 downto 0);
  signal b : signed((1 + B_INT_PART + B_FRACT_PART) - 1 downto 0);

  -- We want c = a + b without loss
  signal c : signed((a'length + b'length) - 1 downto 0);
begin
  process(CLK)
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then
      c <= a * b;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioural;
```

With fixed_pkg library

```vhdl
architecture behavioural of entity is
  signal a : sfixed(A_INT_PART downto -A_FRACT_PART);
  signal b : sfixed(B_INT_PART downto -B_FRACT_PART);

  -- We want c = a + b without loss
  signal c : sfixed(sfixed_high(a, '*', b) downto sfixed_low(a, '*', b));
begin
  process(CLK)
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then
      c <= a * b;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioural;
```
