# Mathematical description

### Result 1

In classical physics, $\phi(t)$ can be expressed as

$$\phi(t) = t + \frac{d_a(t)}{c}$$

With
- $d_a$ the absolute distance travelled by the wave between the instant of emission and the instant of reception
- $c$ The celerity of the travelling wave

#### Application

Let's consider the following situation:

- The source $S$, initially at coordinates $(d_0, 0)$, move at speed $v_S$ along $x$ axis.
- The receiver $R$, initially at coordinated $(0, 0)$, move at speed $v_R$ along the $x$ axis.

Let's consider a wave emitted at instant $t$ by the source. The travelling time of this wave is :

$$\Delta t = \frac{d_a(t)}{c}$$

And, $d_a(t)$ can be expressed by the absolute value of the difference between the initial position of $S$ and the final position of $R$:

$$d_a(t) = \lvert v_S t - v_R (t + \Delta t) + d_0 \rvert = \lvert (v_S - v_R)t - v_R \Delta t + d_0 \rvert$$

So, we have the equation :

$$d_a(t) = \left\lvert (v_S - v_R)t - v_R \frac{d_a(t)}{c} + d_0 \right\rvert$$
